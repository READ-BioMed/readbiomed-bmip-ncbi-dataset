# readbiomed-ncbi-pathogen-dataset-generation

This package has been used for the generation of datasets with information about pathogens and MEDLINE citations associated to them using resources from NCBI (
National Center for Biotechnology Information).

This package has code to generate pathogen information in XML format and to build corpora from those XML files for taxonomic pathogens (e.g. bacteria and viruses), PrPSc prions and toxins. 

An example of generated dataset is available [here](https://github.com/READ-BioMed/readbiomed-pathogens-dataset).
